How to run examples
-------------------

1. Install all package dependencies

```
npm install .
```

2. Run to watch changes of `src` directory and build it to `.` directory

```
npm run watchjsx
```

3. And open another terminal to run

```
npm run watch
```

Which will run `browserify` to compile bundle.js for `examples`

4. Start server and access your browser

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then access:

```
http://localhost:8000/examples
```
